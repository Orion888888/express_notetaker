## Start
🧐 # express_notetaker
This is an application that is a notetaker of information.


You can type anything to create your title and then create a note. You can also delete the note by clicking the trash can icon. This app is made with Express.JS backend. The idea of this app is to link the HTML page to the backend server that will communicate with a db file, storing all of the saved notes in JSON format and establishing express pathing. Functionality: GET, POST, and DELETE methods.
